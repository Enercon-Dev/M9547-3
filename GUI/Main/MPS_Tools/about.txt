Ver 2.01 21/08/2012
this version is used in  "M339 New Monitor

changes:
the "BinaryTelLable" Shade effect is not active during control design. this enables to define a lable color during design.
      note: applying this change to older versions is requiers to reset the collors of shaded labels 
the "RecivedTimeout" in "binarySerialPort" is changed so now the received data is sent to the event handler, so in case of receive
    timeout it can be displayed in the log

added ValueToShortString() method to all DB fields


Ver 2.01 27/10/2011
this version is used in "SMBatt Monitor" and "M906 Monitor"

changes:
changed DataBuffer.getBit()
changed DataBuffer.IncBitOffset()
added DataBuffer.ByteSize7bit flag
changed DataBuffer.fillBit()
changed DataBuffer.getBits()
removed DataBuffer.GetBit_7bit()
removed RowIntDecoder7bit
removed AnalogDecoder7bit
removed DataBuffer.
   REASON (all above): improve and simplify managment of Litle/Big Endian buffers and 7bit Bytes.
   main idea is for BigEndian buffers to decod bits (flags, ets) starting from MSbit and for LitleEndian buffers to decod bits starting from LSbit.
   this way it is much easier to handle "jumps" betwin bytes.
   AFFECT: requiers to change the bit decoding order and to add to extract all SPARE bits since the byte round mechanizm was removed.

added SimpleXML.RemoveNodes()
